      I‚Äôm not really sure if you‚Äôre feeling better yet. Maybe you feel a bit better now, but it still sounds like you‚Äôre not fully okay. I just want you to know that I still care about you. And I think, deep down, you probably know that too. There are many people who care about you and want you to get better soon. I‚Äôm one of them. But I‚Äôm not just someone who says ‚Äúget well soon‚Äù and walks away. I really mean it. I want to be here for you and take care of you in a real way.
Spending hours learning how to write code isn‚Äôt something I usually do. And yeah, maybe I‚Äôll get sick like you too. But if doing this helps you feel a little less alone, a little more cared for, then I‚Äôm okay with that. If I get to see you smile again, and hear your voice, the voice that made me fall for you in the first place, If I end up getting a little sick too, then it‚Äôs worth it to me.

So please, rest well. Drink something warm. Take care of yourself. And just remember, I‚Äôm still here, Always here
<p class="message">
    I know you‚Äôre a talkative person, so your throat must hurt a lot. Honestly, seeing you sick like this really upsets me. I don‚Äôt like anything that causes you pain or makes you cry. I can‚Äôt forgive that, and I can‚Äôt forgive myself either for not taking good care of you.
Anyway, I just hope your voice comes back to normal soon. I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôve debated yet, and I‚Äôm worried that your throat might hurt. So don‚Äôt forget to take your medicine and follow what your parents or doctors say. And don‚Äôt trust Dr. Punch, haha,  that person‚Äôs really unreliable. You probably know they talk a lot but don‚Äôt actually follow through, even they can‚Äôt trust themselves.
But the one thing Dr. Punch is sure about is that you‚Äôll be bright and cheerful again very soon.

    <strong>-Always appreciate you, with all my heart-</strong>
