     I’m truly sorry for all the times I let you down, in the past and even now, because my heart still holds so much love for you. Every time I see you, a quiet guilt lingers inside me. I know I didn’t care for you the way you truly deserved. I understand we’ve stopped talking, and you no longer want me to keep trying. But deep down, I still wish you wouldn’t close your heart completely to what we once had. I know things didn’t work out between us, and that’s okay. I just want you to know that no matter what, I’m here cheering you on from the sidelines. You’ve always been someone truly special, and you deserve all the love and happiness in the world, never doubt that. Whenever you need a friend or just someone to smile with, I’m still around.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #444;">
      Maybe it’s not the right time now, or maybe the future is still uncertain. But I want you to know this, that the love you once gave me, you never chose the wrong person. And I truly believe that by falling for you with all my heart, I made the right choice too. I’m not sure if you still feel anger or hatred towards me right now, but I quietly hope that maybe you do. Perhaps that would help me find my way to move on from you.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #444;">
        I don’t know if you’ve already started something new with someone else. Loving you and wanting you to be happy doesn’t mean the person in front of you has to be someone else. But it’s okay, I understand now.
        And I’m not going to write anything that makes you sit there with a serious face. Maybe right now you’re frowning, a little annoyed, rolling your eyes, or whatever it might be... but no matter what, you still look beautiful. I can’t really blame your parents, they did create the most beautiful curve on your face. And I mean your smile :)
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #444;">
        I think writing and doing things like this helps me feel better, like I’m finally letting out what’s been in my heart. So I’m going to say a lot, whether you read it or not, that’s okay. Before we ended things, I had a little plan for a date. Well, it wasn’t really a date, just the two of us walking around picking flowers and then decorating paper with them. I can’t explain it very well, but I saw it on TikTok and wanted us to do it together. I thought it would be a nice memory.
We never really got much chance to spend meaningful time together, and I’m not very good at love either.
And maybe that makes me look like a fool. 
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #444;">
        I used to believe and I still want to believe that one day, we’ll build a home together. I know that might sound a little silly, but my biggest dream has always been to have a family of my own. And I always imagined building it with you.
A home shaped by your dreams, where we live with patience and understanding. A place where we learn to soften our hearts and work through everything together. A home that brings you comfort and peace. Maybe we’d even raise some rabbits, or have a dog or a cat.
Even though that home doesn’t exist yet, I’ve always felt like you are my home.
Why do I love you this much? Even when you’ve been so unkind to me lately, I still find myself praying for your safety every single night since the day everything changed.
Maybe I’ve been clinging to the idea that meeting you wasn’t just a coincidence. You appeared out of nowhere, and even now, I don’t really understand how. Our school had only just started accepting new students a year ago, and suddenly there you were. So maybe it was you.
You, who helped me forget the pain of the past.
You, who taught me what love could mean.
You, who made me want to give everything I have, sincerely and wholeheartedly, without needing to touch you or even be near you. None of that mattered to me.
Since the moment I started liking you, I’ve never once laid a hand on you because I wanted you to feel safe. And knowing that makes me feel at peace too.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #444;">
        Of course I know I could have done more. I truly wanted to.
But you told me I had already given my all, that it was enough. So I accepted that. At the very least, I had the courage to be honest about my feelings with someone. At least once, I dared to say that I missed you, that I loved you deeply. I was never ashamed to express my feelings to you. There was nothing I wanted to hide, not even the fact that I genuinely wanted to marry you.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #444;">
      I liked you even when you weren’t wearing makeup. Tell me honestly, were you really not wearing any back then? I don’t know, you always looked beautiful to me. And now, with your styled hair and makeup, you look even more stunning. I had already prepared myself for the fact that someone like you would attract a lot of attention. I knew that from the very first moment I started liking you. You were beautiful from the start, and you just keep getting more and more beautiful. When you started doing your hair and makeup, I couldn’t help but admire you. I’ve always noticed, and lately, even more people seem drawn to you. I’m sorry if I’ve ever felt a little insecure. I’ve been by your side for such a long time. I’ve seen how much you’ve grown. I’ve been there from the very beginning, all the way to the point where so many people now surround you. Maybe that’s why I’ve started to feel like I’m slowly fading away.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #444;">
      With the pressure I felt from people around me constantly telling me to do something, I tried. I did something. The pressure faded. But everything else fell apart. Please understand that this is not what I wanted. I am truly sorry. No matter what you hear about me, whether good or bad, If it is not true, I will deny it. Please believe me, I would never hurt someone I love. But if it is true, I am willing to take responsibility and make things right. I never wanted us to become strangers. I could never hate someone I love. I want to become a better version of myself for you, always. And I promise you will see me succeed, just like we once talked about.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #444;">
      I wouldn’t be angry if you hated me or if your feelings for me were gone. Sometimes, I even wish you would hate me, maybe it would help me finally stop holding onto the image of us. Thank you for always reading and listening. Deep down, I still want to keep improving my coding skills. And I always wanted it to be you, the one who would see what I made, give me advice, and help me see where I could grow.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #444;">
      In the end, I guess I’m just someone who dreams a little too much. Please don’t blame me.
      I know I shouldn't have said the word love, because we're just friends and I was only flirting with you. but I can't deny that deep down, I truly want to share my life with you.
