    I’ll add more lyrics and play it for you later when everything is finished. I want you to listen, but right now I’ve written too much and it’s not done yet. I’ll come back to add more later.
Maybe in the future, I’ll play it for you in our home. Just kidding. Sorry, please hate me. I hate myself too...
<p>
   This is a part of my song, and I quite like it
   </p>
   
   </p>
   "The morning light paints gold on every tree.
The flowers dance beneath the summer breeze.
The sky puts on a show in shades of blue.
But none of it compares to simply you.
Because there’s no place that I’d rather be.
Than here with you, where I’m meant to be. 
If you don’t mind, may I stay? Let me be your peace"
</p>

    I really like this verse too. It’s from another song, but it reminds me so much of us. Like,I don’t know where you came from, You appeared out of nowhere, And before I even realized it, I had fallen in love with you completely. I just don’t ever want us to drift apart, Like the way we once were, before I even knew you.
  </p>
    "Cause once you were far away, so I want you to stay"
</p>
</p>
"Once distanced by fate, but now we’re here to stay"
</p>
</p>
"Though fate pulled us apart, love led me back to you”
</p>
<p>
    I know this sounds really cheesy, and honestly, it’s pretty embarrassing. But I think this is probably the last time I’ll get to talk to you. I don’t want any unfinished feelings to linger later on, so I want to give back everything that belongs to you right here.
</p>

  <div class="box">
    <p>"You don't know how much you mean to me"</p>
    <p>"And don't know how can I leave"</p>
    <p>"Cause I see yor face in every dream"</p>
    <p>"But you're too far to see what's underneath"</p>
    <p>This is the last song I wrote for you. Actually, it’s not really the last one, I just wrote another one but only have the melody, no lyrics yet. Honestly, I think I really like this song, and I hope you like it too. I just realized I’ve written almost ten songs for you by now. I’m really happy and I think your songs are the most beautiful. You’ve given me so much encouragement in doing many things. So, thank you truly.</p>
